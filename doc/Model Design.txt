All these data models will be stored in our database.

// File is used to represent a single file, either a photo or video, either being uploaded or downloaded
File:
    session_id
    name // filename
    size // if file is too big, we need to resize it
    thumb_path // thumbnail picture
    path // path to the actual file on server's file system

// Photo is an extension of File
Photo: File

// Video is an extension of File
Video: File

// Session is used to represent a session between a user, either a uploader or a download, and our server
Session:
    id // unique id
    create_time
    expire_time

// Shake is used to represent a phone shake of either a uploader or a downloader
Shake:
    session_id // points to the session that creates this shake
    type // downloader or uploader
    time
    location
    accel_sig // acceleration data signature


Based on the model above, the connection between the uploader and downloader is just a matter of a matching between two Shake objects.

Another interesting thought is RESHAKE, by which I mean we can swap the uploader and downloader without recreating new sessions. That's why I didn't add type in Session but I added it in Shake. Personally I think there is still a lot things we can do after the share is completed, such as share back some other files, or even upload in SNS if possible?
